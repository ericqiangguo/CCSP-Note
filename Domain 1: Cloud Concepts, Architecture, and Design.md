## Understand Cloud Computing Concepts (1.1)
### Cloud Computing Definitions
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.” — National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) definition of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the use of internet-based computing resources, typically “as a service” to internal or external customers, where scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are provided. There are various definitions of what cloud computing means from NIST, Gartner and other leading standards bodies. The NIST definition above is the most commonly and globally used, being cited by professionals and others to clarify what the term “cloud” means.
